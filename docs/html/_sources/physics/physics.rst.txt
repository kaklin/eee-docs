:math:`\Phi_M` - metal workfunction. Minimum energy needed to release an electron from a metal.

:math:`E_p = h\nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda}` - energy of a photon.

:math:`E_k = \frac{p^2}{2m}` - kinetic energy as a function of momentum and mass.

:math:`p=\frac{h}{\lambda}` - momentum of a photon.

:math:`E_k = E_p - \Phi_m` - kinetic energy of an electron released from a metal by a photon with energy :math:`E_p`.
